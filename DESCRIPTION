Description: Protein secondary structure analysis (with STRIDE) and visualization (with ggplot2) for trajectories.
            Two functions are included in this package:
            ssa() will return a data frame that contains residue identifiers (resname_chain_resid; e.g., MET_A_1) as column names and STRIDE assignments of each residue as each row for each frame of the trajectory.
            ssa_plot() ill return a plot that contains percentage of secondary structures observed along the trajectories per residue by comparing the two ssa data frames obtained by ssa().
Imports: ggplot2, ggpubr, ggsci, reshape2, stringi, readr, bio3d, stats
